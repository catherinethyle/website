    <h1>-Artist Biography-</h1>
    <p>
      Catherine Thy Lê is a first generation Vietnamese American interdisciplinary artist living and working out of the Bay Area. She is currently obtaining her Bachelors of Fine Arts with a concentration in Digital Media Art and a minor in sculpture at San Jose State University. Catherine’s art practice is an expression of her own experiences in life, how she sees and interprets the world and society we live in, and topics concerning the mundane. She is a firm believer in art and creation as a powerful tool for expression and rationalization of one's thoughts and experiences. With a background in graphic design, painting, sculpture, and digital art and fabrication, Catherine enjoys the unique capabilities and connotations different mediums provide her with. Her strong interest in conceptual artworks and building narratives gravitate her towards her interdisciplinary practice, where she often incorporates colorful palettes and intricate textures and details.<br><br>

  <h1>-Artist Statement-</h1>
  <p>
    As people and as artists, we all see the world through a different lens built on our own personal experiences, philosophies, beliefs, upbringings, and environments. No two people have the same story and we all bring something unique and beautiful through our existence. We are all navigating this world for the first time, seeing, experiencing, and doing new things. My art practice is my lens that I see and interpret everything through.<br><br>

    My art practice is molded by my unique experiences in life, my relationship to people around me, especially my family, how I see, interpret, and feel about the world and society that we live in, and things that I like, am interested in, or passionate about. I’m an explorer and a wanderer: I gravitate towards various themes and ideas and this translates over to my use of multiple mediums. Creating conceptual and narrative artworks is an integral part to my art practice to help me navigate, illustrate, and rationalize my life and my experiences. Employing these ideas and processes is an outlet for me to process and express things that words sometimes fail to do.<br><br>

    Being interested in the arts for so long, my art practice has been built and shaped by graphic design, drawing, painting, sculpting, metal working, digital rendering and fabrication, mold making and casting, and woodworking. Materiality and the different capabilities different materials have to offer are something I enjoy navigating. What can I say with this material, what can I make with this material, how does this material act when I do this to it? Recently, I’ve been interested in using various materials and techniques to tell a story and create an environment for people to explore, which I think my most recent exhibition, <a href="sweetlikecandy.html">“Sweet Like Candy”</a>, is a perfect example of. For the most part, I really enjoy employing colorful color palettes and busy, maximalist compositions and components in my work. I gravitate towards a kind of colorful chaos in most of my work while other parts of it can be minimal and more formal. Like all other parts of my practice, I try not to box myself in with specific design or aesthetic choices and allow the project to take on whatever look I think will best suit it. I give you all the best I have to offer and different forms and elements of myself that I am piecing together. This is my attempt to immortalize myself as an artist in this lifetime.
