      <h1>"Love in Bounds"</h1>
      <h2>SJSU Theta Belcher Gallery, San Jose, CA, August 2022.</h2>
      <p>
        Love- a feeling, place, emotion, sensation, person, thing. It can be platonic, romantic, or familial, healthy or toxic. There’s a plethora of sensations, experiences, persons, and things that can be associated with love and I have no figured it out at all. It’s complexity and vastness intrigues and confuses me. What is love? What is it like to be in love? What is love to? How do I express and like to receive love? For everyone the answers for these questions are different and unique to their own experiences and confrontations with love in their lives. With “Love in Bounds”, I want to explore and present my different understandings and interpretations with love thus far.<br><br>
        “Love in Bounds” shows my limited and selective understanding, presentation, and interpretation of love. Is love a feeling, person, space, thing, or sensation? How can love be platonic, romantic, healthy, toxic, fulfilling, and detrimental? Love, in my understanding, is complex and simple all at once and for that reason, I don’t think I will be able to fully understand it. Everyone has a unique interpretation and experience with love that shapes their own personal definition and understanding of it. Media, upbringing, outlook on life, and your surroundings shape what love is to you. I hope you are able to resonate with these pieces in some way shape or form and hopefully are able to see a reflection of what love is for you.<br><br>

      <h1>"Light in the Dark"</h1>
      <h2>SJSU Black Gallery, San Jose, CA, February 2023.</h2> 
      <p>
        sometimes when i wake up in the middle of the night i can’t see a thing except the  shadowy silhouettes in the dark. i don’t remember where i am, when i fell asleep, or what god forsaken hour it is. after some time, my eyes adjust to the dark. i’m able to groggily find my way to the door and navigate my way to the bathroom at 2am.<br><br>
        silly analogy aside, there is always light in the dark. hope is not as lost or as nonexistent as we think. we just need time to realize that it is there. “light in the dark” explores hope that surrounds us in our everyday life and experiences and hope for whatever is to come. as terrible and undesirable as the lows in life can be, they are a hurdle for us to cross and a burden for us to carry as part of where and what we come from. why let it weigh us down when there is so much more to come and experience. it is better to fully feel our emotions and handle things with grace than to bottle things up until we are suffocated by them.<br><br>
        i sincerely hope some of this work resonates with you. that it can act as a reassuring word that you’ve been waiting to hear or an embrace that you didn’t know you needed. there is hope, you’re doing great, and it’s going to be okay.<br><br>

    <h1>"Sweet Like Candy"</h1> 
    <h2>SJSU Gallery 5, San Jose, CA, September 2023.</h2>
      <p>
        Things we take for recreation as adults versus as children. A lot of these pastimes are presented in a normalized, idealized, and romanticized way in the media and environments around us as we grow up. It may not seem so at first, but as the saying goes, curiosity killed the cat. With “Sweet Like Candy”, I want to create a space that carries childlike allure and awe in regards to things that children don’t, shouldn’t, or can’t partake in. One try, an innocent little peek, is harmless, right? How bad can a cigarette, a vape, or a drink be? This show is an exploration into installed environments as well as casting in materials like foam (as seen with the vapes nailed into the walls) and plastic (as seen with the cigarettes in the beaded curtain).
