  <h1>-Artist Statement-</h1>
  <p>
    Growing up I drew horses using "How to Draw" books that I borrowed from the library, anime characters that I liked, things that came up under "cool art" on Google Images and Pinterest to name a few. Drawing with pencil in my old composition books turned into using my older sister's old art supplied from an art class she took in middle school, taking my dad's Sharpies he took from work, buying my own acrylic paint, and various other materials. I loved to explore, in life and in art.<br><br>

    On that note, here I am at 21, with various skills and interest under my belt. I can draw, paint, sculpt, weld, cast, build, fabricate, design, illustrate, and render. I am very interested in using different materials and techniques to bring to life projects that are a representation of my world, my beliefs, my understandings, and my feelings about anything and everything. I think the stories we as individuals and people are unique and interesting, and there is always something to learn and take from someone else's experience. My work ranges from topics that have deep conceptual and narrative meaning and ideas behind them, like how addiction and the use of substances is romanticized and normalized, to things that are more lighthearted, like a 3D render of a frog in a strawberry suit. Life is all about balance. Not everything has to be philosophical or serious but it's also important to have those conversations.<br><br>

    For the last year, I've become a lot more interested in bridging digital art techniques with sculptural techniques to create spaces that are visually engaging and immersive. I want to transport the viewer into a world and space that I've fabricated and transformed to tell a certain story, especially those built on topics and experiences that hit close to home for me. I've been especially interested in creating sculptural pieces with the idea of being used in an installation. From there, I've been using digital elements, most recently it has been video projection, to overlay on top of my sculptural pieces. I want to use tangible sculptural objects, digital assets (as part of the fabrication process or as a final element to the installation), and lighting to create an aesthetically and alternatively compelling space.
